I have an hour-long video of a fitness coach performing a full workout routine. The video has no audio or subtitles, and I want to create a professional voiceover script to guide viewers through the session.

Please:
1. Analyze the video and break it down into segments (warm-up, main workout, cooldown, etc.).
2. For each exercise shown, identify the movement and provide:
   - The name of the exercise
   - Number of reps or duration (if estimable)
   - Clear and concise instructional narration in a motivational tone (e.g., "Keep your back straight", "Breathe in as you lower down").
3. Add transitions between exercises and segments (e.g., "Next upâ€¦", "Great job, let's move to the next set!").
4. Maintain a natural timing and pacing for an hour-long session.

The goal is to turn this silent video into a fully guided workout suitable for YouTube or a fitness app.
